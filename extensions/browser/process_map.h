// Contains information about which extensions are assigned to which processes.
//
// The relationship between extensions and processes is complex:
//
// - Extensions can be either "split" mode or "spanning" mode.
// - In spanning mode, extensions *generally* share a single process between all
//   incognito and normal windows. This was the original mode for extensions.
// - In split mode, extensions have separate processes in incognito windows.
// - There are also hosted apps, which are a kind of extensions, and those
//   usually have a process model similar to normal web sites: multiple
//   processes per-profile.
// - A single hosted app can have more than one SiteInstance in the same process
//   if we're over the process limit and force them to share a process.
// - An extension can also opt into Cross Origin Isolation in which case it can
//   have multiple processes per profile since cross-origin-isolated and
//   non-cross-origin-isolated contexts don't share a process.
//
// In general, we seem to play with the process model of extensions a lot, so
// it is safest to assume it is many-to-many in most places in the codebase.
//
// Note that because of content scripts, frames, and other edge cases in
// Chrome's process isolation, extension code can still end up running outside
// an assigned process.
//
// But we only allow high-privilege operations to be performed by an extension
// when it is running in an assigned process.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WARNINGS - PLEASE UNDERSTAND THESE BEFORE CALLING OR MODIFYING THIS CLASS
// ===========================================================================
//
// 1. This class contains the processes for hosted apps as well as extensions
//    and packaged apps. Just because a process is present here *does not* mean
//    it is an "extension process" (e.g., for UI purposes). It may contain only
//    hosted apps. See crbug.com/102533.
//
// 2. An extension can show up in multiple processes. That is why there is no
//    GetExtensionProcess() method here. There are multiple such cases:
//      a) The extension is actually a hosted app.
//      b) There is an incognito window open and the extension is "split mode".
//      c) The extension is cross origin isolated but has
//         non-cross-origin-isolated contexts.
//    It is *not safe* to assume that there is one process per extension.
//
// 3. The process ids contained in this class are *not limited* to the Profile
//    you got this map from. They can also be associated with that profile's
//    incognito/normal twin. If you care about this, use
//    RenderProcessHost::FromID() and check the profile of the resulting object.
//
// TODO(aa): The above warnings suggest this class could use improvement :).
//
// TODO(kalman): This class is not threadsafe, but is used on both the UI and IO
//               threads. Somebody should fix that, either make it threadsafe or
//               enforce single thread. Investigation required.

  // Gets the most likely context type for the process with ID |process_id|
  // which hosts Extension |extension|, if any (may be nullptr). Context types
  // are renderer (JavaScript) concepts but the browser can do a decent job in
  // guessing what the process hosts.
  //
  // For Context types with no |extension| e.g. untrusted WebUIs, we use |url|
  // which should correspond to the URL where the API is running.|url| could be
  // the frame's URL, the Content Script's URL, or the URL where a Content
  // Script is running. So |url| should only be used when there is no
  // |extension|. |url| may be also be nullptr when running in Service Workers.
  // Currently, the |url| provided by event_router.cc is passed from the
  // renderer process and therefore can't be fully trusted.
  // TODO(ortuno): Change call sites to only pass in a URL when |extension| is
  // nullptr and only use a URL retrieved from the browser process.
  //
  // |extension| is the funky part - unfortunately we need to trust the
  // caller of this method to be correct that indeed the context does feature
  // an extension. This matters for iframes, where an extension could be
  // hosted in another extension's process (privilege level needs to be
  // downgraded) or in a web page's process (privilege level needs to be
  // upgraded).
  //
  // The latter of these is slightly problematic from a security perspective;
  // if a web page renderer gets owned it could try to pretend it's an
  // extension and get access to some unprivileged APIs. Luckly, when OOP
  // iframes lauch, it won't be an issue.
  //
  // Anyhow, the expected behaviour is:
  //   - For hosted app processes, this will be blessed_web_page.
  //   - For processes of platform apps running on lock screen, this will be
  //     lock_screen_extension.
  //   - For other extension processes, this will be blessed_extension.
  //   - For WebUI processes, this will be a webui.
  //   - For chrome-untrusted:// URLs, this will be a webui_untrusted_context.
  //   - For any other extension we have the choice of unblessed_extension or
  //     content_script. Since content scripts are more common, guess that.
  //     We *could* in theory track which web processes have extension frames
  //     in them, and those would be unblessed_extension, but we don't at the
  //     moment, and once OOP iframes exist then there won't even be such a
  //     thing as an unblessed_extension context.
  //   - For anything else, web_page.
