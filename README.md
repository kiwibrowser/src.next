# Kiwi Browser Next

Source-code for Kiwi Next, a Kiwi Browser auto-rebased with latest [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/).

This repository is the control center for development, testing and deployment of new releases.

If you are looking into modifying or improving Kiwi Browser, you are at the right place.

The mindset behind this project is that you should be able to modify and create a modification of Kiwi Browser directly from within Kiwi Browser (without the need of a computer).

Keep it in mind, if you need a computer to do a change, it means it's too complicated. Even rebasing should be doable from the GitHub user interface.

Servers are paid-for and sponsored by Geometry OU (the company behind Kiwi Browser), and additional computing hours for contributors are provided for free by Microsoft Azure via GitHub Actions.

If you want to join the development process or read more about the technical work behind, or topics like `Contributing` , `Development` and `Workflows`, just click on the Wiki below:

## License

This repository is licensed under the same license as Chromium.
Chromium uses a very permissive and advantageous license. To keep this freedom we don't want to include code from much more restrictive licenses (for example GPL, or CC-NC).

It is very important to keep attribution to Kiwi Browser.
You can use the exact wording written in LICENSE, or use "Based on Kiwi Browser".

Google has established a list of licenses that shouldn't be included in Chromium, we follow this list, and you can find the list below.

See `restricted` in https://opensource.google/docs/thirdparty/licenses/

Verify before proposing code to Kiwi Browser that the code doesn't come from such restricted projects.
