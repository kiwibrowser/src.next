  // considered dangerous if SafeBrowsing returns an unknown verdict.
  //
  // Note that some downloads (e.g. "Save link as" on a link to a binary) would
  // not be considered 'Dangerous' even if SafeBrowsing came back with an
  // unknown verdict. So we can't always show a warning when SafeBrowsing fails.

  //   ALLOW_ON_USER_GESTURE : If SafeBrowsing claims the file is safe, then the
  //       file is safe. An UNKOWN verdict results in the file being marked as
  //       DANGEROUS_FILE.
  //
  //   DANGEROUS : This type of file shouldn't be allowed to download witout any
  //       user action. Hence, if SafeBrowsing marks the file as SAFE, or
  //       UNKONWN, the file will still be conisdered a DANGEROUS_FILE. However,
