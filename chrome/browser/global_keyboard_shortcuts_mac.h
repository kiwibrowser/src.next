// macOS applications are supposed to put all keyEquivalents [hotkeys] in the

// that are explicitly coded to virtual keycodes. This has the following
// downsides:
//  * There is no way for the user to configure or disable these keyEquivalents.
//  * This can cause keyEquivalent conflicts for non-US keyboard layouts with
//    different default keyEquivalents, see https://crbug.com/841299.
//
// This function first searches the menu bar for a matching keyEquivalent. If
// nothing is found, then it searches through the explicitly coded virtual
// keycodes not present in the NSMenu.
//
// Note: AppKit exposes symbolic hotkeys [e.g. cmd + `] not present in the
// NSMenu as well. The user can remap these to conflict with Chrome hotkeys.
// This function will return the Chrome hotkey, regardless of whether there's a
// conflicting symbolic hotkey.
