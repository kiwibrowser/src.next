Instructions for adding/updating dependencies are in:
    //third_party/android_deps/README.md

Vulnerability detection: fetch_all.py runs 'gradle dependencyCheckAnalyze' to look
for known vulnerabilities each time the script is run. It is expected that Vomit
(go/vomit) will absorb this responsibility in future.
