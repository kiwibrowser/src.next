# This file contains a list of paths to gradle files for projects which have
# dependencies on libraries defined in this gradle project. The paths should be
# relative to --android-deps-dir .

# RATIONALE
# In order to pick a version of a library which is compatible with all of the
# targets which depend on it (including targets in other gradle projects) the
# 'setupRepository' task needs to be aware of all gradle projects with targets
# which depend on libraries defined in this gradle project.
#
# This file is also useful in the situation:
# - Another gradle project forwards internal dependencies to this project
#   (e.g. androidx project forwards internal non-androidx dependencies to
#    android_deps project).
# - No target in this project depends on forwarded internal dependencies.
