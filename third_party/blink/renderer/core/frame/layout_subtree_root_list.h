// by their layout. This is an optimization to avoid doing extra work and tree
// walking during layout. See objectIsRelayoutBoundary for the criteria for
// being a root.
// These roots are sorted into a vector ordered by their depth in the tree,
// and returned one by one deepest first for layout. This is necessary in the
// case of nested subtree roots where a positioned object is added to the
// contained root but its containing block is above that root.
// It ensures we add positioned objects to their containing block's positioned
// descendant lists before laying out those objects if they're contained in
// a higher root.
// TODO(leviw): This should really be something akin to a LayoutController
// that FrameView delegates layout work to.
