// PaintLayer is an old object that handles lots of unrelated operations.
//
// We want it to die at some point and be replaced by more focused objects,
// which would remove (or at least compartmentalize) a lot of complexity.
// See the STATUS OF PAINTLAYER section below.
//
// The class is central to painting and hit-testing. That's because it handles
// a lot of tasks (we included ones done by associated satellite objects for
// historical reasons):
// - Complex painting operations (opacity, clipping, filters, reflections, ...).
// - hardware acceleration (through PaintLayerCompositor).
// - scrolling (through PaintLayerScrollableArea).
// - some performance optimizations.
//
// The compositing code is also based on PaintLayer. The entry to it is the
// PaintLayerCompositor, which fills |composited_layer_mapping| for hardware
// accelerated layers.
//
// TODO(jchaffraix): Expand the documentation about hardware acceleration.
//
//
// ***** SELF-PAINTING LAYER *****
// One important concept about PaintLayer is "self-painting"
// (is_self_painting_layer_).
// PaintLayer started as the implementation of a stacking context. This meant
// that we had to use PaintLayer's painting order (the code is now in
// PaintLayerPainter and PaintLayerStackingNode) instead of the LayoutObject's
// children order. Over the years, as more operations were handled by
// PaintLayer, some LayoutObjects that were not stacking context needed to have
// a PaintLayer for bookkeeping reasons. One such example is the overflow hidden
// case that wanted hardware acceleration and thus had to allocate a PaintLayer
// to get it. However overflow hidden is something LayoutObject can paint
// without a PaintLayer, which includes a lot of painting overhead. Thus the
// self-painting flag was introduced. The flag is a band-aid solution done for
// performance reason only. It just brush over the underlying problem, which is
// that its design doesn't match the system's requirements anymore.
//
// Note that the self-painting flag determines how we paint a LayoutObject:
// - If the flag is true, the LayoutObject is painted through its PaintLayer,
//   which is required to apply complex paint operations. The paint order is
//   handled by PaintLayerPainter::paintChildren, where we look at children
//   PaintLayers.
// - If the flag is false, the LayoutObject is painted like normal children (ie
//   as if it didn't have a PaintLayer). The paint order is handled by
//   BlockPainter::paintChild that looks at children LayoutObjects.
// This means that the self-painting flag changes the painting order in a subtle
// way, which can potentially have visible consequences. Those bugs are called
// painting inversion as we invert the order of painting for 2 elements
// (painting one wrongly in front of the other).
// See https://crbug.com/370604 for an example.
//
//
// ***** STATUS OF PAINTLAYER *****
// We would like to remove this class in the future. The reasons for the removal
// are:
// - it has been a dumping ground for features for too long.
// - it is the wrong level of abstraction, bearing no correspondence to any CSS
//   concept.
//
// Its features need to be migrated to helper objects. This was started with the
// introduction of satellite objects: PaintLayer*. Those helper objects then
// need to be moved to the appropriate LayoutObject class, probably to a rare
// data field to avoid growing all the LayoutObjects.
//
// A good example of this is PaintLayerScrollableArea, which can only happen
// be instanciated for LayoutBoxes. With the current design, it's hard to know
// that by reading the code.
