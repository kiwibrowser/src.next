    When an outermost SVG 'svg' element is stand-alone or embedded inline within a parent XML grammar 
    which does not use CSS layout [CSS2-LAYOUT] or XSL formatting [XSL], the 'overflow' property on the 
    outermost 'svg' element is ignored for the purposes of visual rendering and the initial clipping path is set 
    to the bounds of the initial viewport.

    When an outermost 'svg' element is embedded inline within a parent XML grammar which uses CSS layout
    [CSS2-LAYOUT] or XSL formatting [XSL], if the 'overflow' property has the value hidden or scroll, then
    the user agent will establish an initial clipping path equal to the bounds of the initial viewport; otherwise,
    the initial clipping path is set according to the clipping rules as defined in [CSS2-overflow].

    Opera/Firefox & WebKit agreed on NOT setting "overflow: hidden" for a root svg element - SVG 1.1 Errata
    contains these changes as well as all future SVG specifications: see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-svg-wg/2008JulSep/0347.html
    Note that here "root svg element" means when <svg> is the document element. (":root" in CSS parlance.)
    LayoutSVGRoot objects embedded within containing content get overflow: hidden by default.
