# src/content is a large and complex component. In general, files should be in
# subdirectories that have specific owners who are the experts in reviewing that
# code. Top level content/OWNERS are reviewers who are qualified to review
# changes across all of content and are responsible for its architecture. They
# will defer to subdirectory owners as needed. As such we expect that a
# content/OWNER has made substantial contributions to content/ in the recent
# past, specifically both in the browser and renderer subdirectories as they
# encapsulate the main architecture, and demonstrated overall knowledge of the
# content architecture by doing code reviews for changes that affect different
# parts of content even before being a content/OWNER.
#
# For public questions directed to OWNERS, you can send email
# to content-owners@chromium.org.
